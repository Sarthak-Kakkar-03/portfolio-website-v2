His performance was nothing short of exceptional.\n\nSarthak successfully developed a sophisticated integrated research-grade system that combined neuromuscular electrical stimulators with both wired and wireless user input devices, plus Bluetooth-connected force gauges. This complex project required not only deep technical expertise but also the ability to navigate the unique challenges of working in a multidisciplinary environment.\n\nWhat truly set Sarthak apart was his remarkable ability to bridge technical and non-technical worlds. Working alongside medical professionals who didn't share his engineering background, he demonstrated exceptional communication skills, translating complex technical concepts into accessible language while maintaining the precision necessary for our research applications.\n\nThroughout the project, Sarthak consistently delivered timely updates, proactively identified potential issues, and engineered efficient solutions to problems as they arose. His adaptability shone when project scope evolved—he embraced changes seamlessly and actually took the work beyond what I had originally envisioned.\n\nSarthak combines strong technical fundamentals with excellent project management instincts and collaborative skills that make him invaluable on any engineering team. Any organization would be fortunate to have someone with his blend of technical expertise, communication abilities, and professional maturity.\n\nI recommend Sarthak without reservation and look forward to seeing the continued impact he'll make in his engineering career.",
